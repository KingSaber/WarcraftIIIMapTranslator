Translating Maps With A Very Gimmicky Code

Requirements:

Python "https://www.python.org/" I use python 3.7

Pyw3x "https://github.com/sethmachine/pyw3x" I use sethmachines library to edit mpqs in my program.


Notes: 
So far this translator only supports chinese and requires you to translate your strings with a third party tool. I personally use google translate
documents to quickly translate my maps. There are a few bugs where the regex only finds half sentences leading to choppy sentences being translated
part by part. Despite being very simple and rough around the edges this code can save hundreds of hours translating maps and can quickly be improved.
